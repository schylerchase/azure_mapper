## What It Does

Paste Azure CLI JSON exports (or scan directly from the desktop app) and get an interactive network map with compliance scoring, traffic flow tracing, governance rules, and exportable reports. Zero backend, zero dependencies for the browser version.

> **Looking for AWS?** See [AWS Network Mapper](https://github.com/schylerchase/aws_mapper) for the AWS equivalent.

## Features

### Visualization
- D3.js SVG canvas with VNets, public/private subnets, NSGs, peerings, firewalls, and 30+ resource types
- Three layout modes: **Grid** (columns), **Landing Zone** (hub-spoke), **Executive Overview**
- Traffic flow tracing with NSG rule evaluation and flow analysis dashboard
- Blast radius analysis for any resource
- Detail level cycling (collapsed / default / expanded) with keyboard shortcuts
- **Design Mode**: build infrastructure from scratch with a drag-and-drop palette

### Compliance Engine
28 controls across 4 frameworks, evaluated against every applicable resource:

| Framework | Controls | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| CIS Azure 3.0 | 8 | NSG rules, storage encryption, disk encryption, Bastion |
| Azure Architecture | 15 | Best practices, HA, private endpoints, network segmentation |
| SOC 2 | 2 | TLS enforcement, outbound access controls |
| PCI DSS | 3 | Network segmentation, admin credentials, HTTPS listeners |

Full compliance dashboard with severity filtering, framework breakdowns, and remediation guidance.

### Governance Rules Engine
- Automatic resource classification with tiered governance (Critical / High / Standard / Low)
- Pattern-based rule matching with pre-compiled RegExp for performance
- Governance dashboard with per-tier breakdown and CSV/JSON export

### NSG / Firewall Dashboard
- Unified view of all NSGs and their security rules
- Search, filter by direction/access, sort by name or open ingress count
- Summary cards: total NSGs, total rules, allow rules, open ingress
- Export as CSV, JSON, or Azure CLI commands

### Report Builder
Modular report generator with drag-to-reorder sections, live preview, and standalone HTML export:
- Executive Summary
- Compliance Report
- Resource Governance
- Resource Inventory
- NSG Rule Summary
- Architecture Notes

### Flow Analysis
- Traffic flow tracing between any source/destination with NSG rule evaluation
- Flow exposure dashboard ranking subnets by exposure level
- One-click trace launch from context menu or flow entries

### Export Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| PNG | Map screenshot |
| SVG | Vector format |
| Terraform HCL | Azure provider with `azurerm` resources |
| ARM Template | Native Azure JSON deployment template |
| Bicep | Azure DSL format |
| HTML Report | Standalone assessment report |
| CSV / XLSX | Compliance findings and NSG rules |
| .azmap | Full project save/restore |

### Other Capabilities
- Snapshot timeline: capture, browse, and compare historical infrastructure states
- Diff/change detection between snapshots
- Annotations: pin searchable notes to any resource
- Resource search with fuzzy matching
- Context menus with resource-specific actions
- Auto-save to browser every 30 seconds

## Quick Start

### Browser (no install)

1. Open the [live demo](https://schylerchase.github.io/azure_mapper/) or `index.html` locally
2. Click **Load Demo** or paste Azure CLI JSON into the input fields
3. Click **Render Map**

### Desktop App (Electron)

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/schylerchase/azure_mapper/releases/latest). Available for macOS (.dmg), Windows (.exe), and Linux (.AppImage).

The desktop app adds:
- **Scan Azure** button -- runs Azure CLI commands automatically
- Native file save/open/export dialogs
- **Import Folder** for bulk JSON loading
- XLSX compliance export
- Auto-update via GitHub Releases

### Export Azure Data

A Bash export script is included for extracting data from your Azure subscriptions:

```bash
./export-azure-data.sh -s my-subscription
./export-azure-data.sh -s my-subscription -g my-resource-group
./export-azure-data.sh -s my-subscription -l eastus
```

The script runs 30+ `az` CLI commands and outputs JSON files ready for import.
